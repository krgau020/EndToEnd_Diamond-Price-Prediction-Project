### Advanced Machine Learning Models ü§ñ

Our project now incorporates advanced machine learning models for diamond price prediction. These models offer improved accuracy and generalization.

#### Web Application üåê

We are thrilled to present our web-based user interface for easy input and prediction of diamond prices. You can now interact with our model through a user-friendly web application.

- **Input Form:** Users can input various attributes of a diamond, including carat, depth, table, dimensions (x, y, z), cut, color, and clarity.
- **Machine Learning Prediction:** The application uses a trained machine learning model to predict the price of the diamond based on the provided attributes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web app features an attractive and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to enter data and receive predictions.
- **Background Image:** The app uses a captivating background image to enhance the visual appeal and engagement of users.

### Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

The dataset used in the Diamond Price Prediction Web App project is a collection of diamond attributes and their corresponding prices. The dataset is utilized to train a machine learning model that can predict the price of a diamond based on its various characteristics. The dataset provides a valuable resource for understanding the relationships between diamond attributes and their market values.

#### Attributes in the Dataset:

- `carat`: Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
- `cut`: Quality of Diamond Cut.
- `color`: Color of Diamond.
- `clarity`: Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
- `depth`: The depth of the diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface).
- `table`: A diamond's table is the facet that can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
- `x`: Diamond X dimension.
- `y`: Diamond Y dimension.
- `z`: Diamond Z dimension.
